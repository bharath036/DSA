A string is a sequence of characters.
A string uses ' or ".
For strings + means concatenate.
When a string contains numbers it is still a string. We can convert string to integer and vice-versa.
--> we can get any single character in a string using index specified in square bracket

fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)
output: a 

--> The built-in function len gives length of string
--> Using while statement and an iteration variable, and length 
function , we can construct a loop to look each of the letters in 
a string individually.

fruit = 'banana'
index = 0
while index < length(fruit):
	letter = fruit[index]
	print(index,letter)
	index +=1
