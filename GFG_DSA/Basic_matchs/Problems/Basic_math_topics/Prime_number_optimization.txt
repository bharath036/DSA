## **Optimized Prime Number Check Explanation**

### **Code Implementation**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPrime(self, N):
        if N == 1:  # 1 is not a prime number
            return False

        if N == 2 or N == 3:  # 2 and 3 are prime numbers
            return True

        if N % 2 == 0 or N % 3 == 0:  # Eliminate even numbers and multiples of 3
            return False

        i = 5
        while i * i <= N:  # Check divisibility using numbers of the form (6k Â± 1)
            if N % i == 0 or N % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6  # Move to the next potential prime divisor

        return True
```

### **Understanding the Optimization**

#### **1. Handling Small Numbers Efficiently**
- Directly return `False` for `N == 1` since 1 is not prime.  
- Return `True` for `N == 2` or `N == 3` since they are prime.  

#### **2. Eliminating Even Numbers and Multiples of 3**
- If `N` is even (`N % 2 == 0`) or a multiple of 3 (`N % 3 == 0`), return `False`.  
- This eliminates unnecessary checks for even numbers and numbers divisible by 3.  

#### **3. Checking Only Numbers of the Form `6k Â± 1`**
- All prime numbers greater than 3 can be written as `6k Â± 1` (where `k` is an integer).  
- Instead of checking every number, we only check divisibility by `i` (starting from `5`) and `i + 2` (next odd number).
- We increment `i` by `6` in each iteration to efficiently cover potential primes.

---

### **Why is This Faster?**
- **Reduces the number of checks from `O(N)` to `O(âˆšN)`.**  
- **Skips even numbers and multiples of 3**, reducing unnecessary computations.  
- **Only checks numbers in the form `6k Â± 1`**, avoiding redundant checks.  

ðŸš€ **This method significantly improves performance for large values of `N`!**

**# Optimized Prime Check - Explanation**

### **Understanding the Optimization Logic**

When checking if a number `N` is prime, we optimize the process to reduce unnecessary calculations. Hereâ€™s how:

---

### **1. Handling Small Cases Directly**
- If `N = 1`, return `False` because 1 is not a prime number.
- If `N = 2` or `N = 3`, return `True` because these are the smallest prime numbers.

---

### **2. Eliminating Obvious Non-Prime Numbers**
- If `N` is **even (`N % 2 == 0`)**, itâ€™s **not prime** (except for `2`).
- If `N` is **a multiple of 3 (`N % 3 == 0`)**, itâ€™s **not prime** (except for `3`).

This immediately removes half of the numbers (even numbers) and one-third of the remaining numbers (multiples of 3), making our check much faster.

---

### **3. Only Checking Numbers of the Form `6k Â± 1`**
#### **Why `6k Â± 1`?**
- Every prime number **greater than 3** is of the form `6k Â± 1`, where `k` is an integer.
- Numbers that are **divisible by 2 or 3** are already eliminated.
- This means we only need to check numbers like `5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25...` instead of checking every number up to `N`.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
Instead of checking every number, we skip directly to numbers that *could* be prime:
- `5, 7`
- `11, 13`
- `17, 19`
- `23, 25`, etc.

This reduces the number of checks drastically.

---

### **4. Stopping at âˆšN Instead of N**
Instead of looping from `2` to `N-1`, we only check up to `âˆšN` because:
- If `N` has a factor larger than `âˆšN`, then it must have a smaller factor **before** `âˆšN`.
- This reduces the number of checks from **`O(N)` to `O(âˆšN)`**, making it much faster.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
For `N = 49`, we only check up to `âˆš49 = 7` instead of all numbers up to `49`.

---

### **Final Optimized Approach**
1. Check small cases (`1, 2, 3`) directly.
2. Eliminate obvious cases (`even numbers` and `multiples of 3`).
3. Only check numbers of the form `6k Â± 1`.
4. Stop checking at `âˆšN`.

This reduces unnecessary calculations, making the algorithm **much faster and more efficient**. ðŸš€
